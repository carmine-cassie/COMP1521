Hey everybody! This is where I'll put any code I write during each week's labs, as well as my slides.

I've left the slides and code from my last term here, so that you have as many resources as you could possibly want.

## My VSCode Extensions (as a treat)
Here's a quick rundown on the extensions I use to make my VSCode look the way it does.

### [Mipsy Editor Features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xavc.xavc-mipsy-features)
The most important VSCode extension for this course is the **Mipsy Editor Features** extension, by Xavier Cooney.

This extension provides the syntax highlighting for assembly files, so you get all those pretty colours!

### [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)
Marp is the extension I use to create my slides in markdown.

If you want to see the slides on this repo as slides rather than just text, install the **Marp for VS Code** extension, right click on the file, and select `Open Preview`.

### [Synthwave x Fluoromachine & epic animations](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheCodemonkey.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-epic-animations)
This is the frankly silly VSCode theme I use, which provides the glowing text, the animated grid, scanlines, etc.

It requires a bit of setup, including installing the [Custom CSS and JSS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension, which should tell you about the safety and the complexity of the extension - install at your own risk! (I haven't had any problems so far, though.)

I *believe* I modified my local version of this extension because one of the animations was annoying me, but that would've been a while ago so I barely remember what I did!
