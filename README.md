Hey everybody, welcome to COMP1521! On this page you can find the slides and code I deliver and write during my tutorials!

## VSCode Setup!
For this course, we use a lot of tools that are only installed on UNSW CSE machines, so you'll need to have a way to access a CSE terminal.

Your big options here are:
- Using a computer in the lab room
- TigerVNC
- Setting up SSH (following either [this beginner guide](https://abiram.me/cse-setup) or [this more advanced one](https://abiram.me/cse-sshfs))

Additionally, you'll probably be interested in these two VSCode extensions:

### [Mipsy Editor Features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xavc.xavc-mipsy-features)
Throughout this course we program a lot in our own special spinoff of MIPS Assembly language, called *Mipsy!* If you want to have your code to have beautiful and correct syntax highlighting (colours), you'll want to grab this extension.

> Fun Fact: this extension is written by Xavier Cooney, one of our Course Admins!

### [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)
This extension is far less useful, it's just what I use in tutorials to present Markdown documents as if they were slideshows - feel free to grab it if, for whatever reason, you have your heart set on viewing the slides exactly as they look in person.

(To view the slideshow, right click on the file, and select `Open Preview`.)
